# prr

An sensible alternative to `Object.defineProperty()`. Available in npm and Ender as **prr**.

## Usage

Set the property `'foo'` \(`obj.foo`\) to have the value `'bar'` with default options \(`'enumerable'`, `'configurable'` and `'writable'` are all `false`\):

```javascript
prr(obj, 'foo', 'bar')
```

Adjust the default options:

```javascript
prr(obj, 'foo', 'bar', { enumerable: true, writable: true })
```

Do the same operation for multiple properties:

```javascript
prr(obj, { one: 'one', two: 'two' })
// or with options:
prr(obj, { one: 'one', two: 'two' }, { enumerable: true, writable: true })
```

### Simplify!

But obviously, having to write out the full options object makes it nearly as bad as the original `Object.defineProperty()` so we can simplify.

As an alternative method we can use an options string where each character represents a option: `'e'=='enumerable'`, `'c'=='configurable'` and `'w'=='writable'`:

```javascript
prr(obj, 'foo', 'bar', 'ew') // enumerable and writable but not configurable
// muliple properties:
prr(obj, { one: 'one', two: 'two' }, 'ewc') // configurable too
```

## Where can I use it?

Anywhere! For pre-ES5 environments _prr_ will simply fall-back to an `object[property] = value` so you can get close to what you want.

_prr_ is Ender-compatible so you can include it in your Ender build and `$.prr(...)` or `var prr = require('prr'); prr(...)`.
